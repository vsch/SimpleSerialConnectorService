<p>Exposes <a href="https://github.com/java-native/jssc">jscc</a> serial library as a service to allow multiple plugins to share the library and
provide serial port connectivity without conflicting with each other.</p>
<p>To make the service compatible with now JetBrains maintained <code>Serial Monitor</code> plugin, the
service and associated interfaces were copied into this plugin. The goal was to use <code>Serial Monitor</code> plugin, if it is installed, by delegating all calls to its <code>JsscSerialService</code>. If the
<code>Serial Monitor</code> plugin is not installed, then this plugin provides the service via the <a href="https://github.com/java-native/jssc">jscc</a>
library.</p>
<p>Effectively, any plugin can implement serial monitoring by including this plugin as a dependency
and seamlessly provide serial port communication with or without <code>Serial Monitor</code> being
installed or compatible with an earlier version of the IDE.</p>
<hr>  
<p>This plugin is intended to be installed as a dependency of other plugins since it exposes no
user functionality of its own.</p>
