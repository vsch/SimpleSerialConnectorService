<p>This plugin is intended to be installed as a dependency of other plugins since it exposes no
user functionality of its own. See <a href="https://github.com/vsch/SimpleSerialConnectorService/blob/master/README.md">README</a> file for configuring your plugin build to use this
plugin&rsquo;s <code>JsscSerialService</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Exposes <a href="https://github.com/java-native/jssc">jscc - Java Simple Serial Connector</a> serial library as a service to allow multiple
plugins to share the library and provide serial port connectivity without conflicting with each
other.</p>
<p>The service provided by this plugin is a clone of one in the JetBrains <code>Serial Port Monitor</code>
plugin. The intention is to use the <code>Serial Port Monitor</code> plugin, if it is installed, by delegating
all calls to its <code>JsscSerialService</code>. If the <code>Serial Port Monitor</code> plugin is not installed, then this
plugin provides the service via the <a href="https://github.com/java-native/jssc">jscc - Java Simple Serial Connector</a> library.</p>
<p>Effectively, any plugin can implement serial monitoring by including this plugin as a dependency
and seamlessly provide serial port communication with or without <code>Serial Monitor</code> being
installed or compatible with an earlier version of the IDE.</p>
<p>Currently, it is not possible to use <code>Serial Port Monitor</code>&rsquo;s classes in a dependent plugin.
Using this library may still conflict with <code>Serial Port Monitor</code> loading of native libraries.</p>
<p>Implement serial port connectivity by using this plugin as a dependency, to avoid conflicting
with other plugins is still preferable.</p>
